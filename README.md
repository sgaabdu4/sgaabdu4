Currently, I recently worked for around 3 years as a Cybersecurity Consultant at PwC UK. While cybersecurity isn't my first love, it's brought a ton of interesting puzzles my way. 🕵️‍♂️💻 However, my real passion lies in coding and creating. I absolutely love Flutter, Dart, and Python - they're my go-to tools for bringing ideas to life! 📱👨‍💻

I've got a knack for diving into complex problems and emerging with innovative solutions. Whether it's developing telemedicine apps during COVID-19 or crafting interactive robot applications for hospitals, I'm all about making tech work for people. 🏥🤖

Good news! I've completed my Masters in Cybersecurity at Cardiff University. 🎓 It's been an amazing journey, but I'm glad to be focusing more on what I love most - coding and problem-solving.

Outside of work, I'm an avid volunteer, contributing to PwC's CSR Committee and the Muslim Network. Here, I blend my love for technology with community service, automating stuff (because it's fun!) and designing user-friendly apps. 🌍❤️

I'm always on the lookout for the next intriguing project or a friendly chat about the latest in tech. If you're into creating innovative solutions and tackling tech challenges, let's connect! 🤝

Together, we can transform every keystroke into digital Sadaqah, elevating our coding into a legacy of innovation and benevolence. 💻🤝🌟
