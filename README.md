Hey, I'm Abid. I'm a builder who loves solving tricky problems with code. My toolkit is mostly Flutter, Dart, and Python.

By day, I'm a Senior Flutter Developer at Greggs (yes, that Greggs!). Before this, I spent about 3.5 years in the cybersecurity world at PwC, which was a great learning experience but ultimately taught me that I'd rather be building things than breaking them.

What I'm working on:
Right now, I'm diving deeper into advanced Flutter and sharpening my Python skills. I'm always tinkering with a few side projects, usually involving AI or web apps.

What I'm looking for:
I'm open to collaborating on any project that's genuinely challenging, especially if it involves large-scale apps or cloud tech. I'm driven by the idea of turning code into a force for goodâ€”what I like to call "digital Sadaqah."

Ask me about: Flutter, Dart, Python, or my journey from cybersecurity to mobile dev.

Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, teaching, or learning more about religions.
